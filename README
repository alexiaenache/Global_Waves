The structure of the app:
The classes Command and Filters are used to read the input file. The Player class represents
an application that manages libraries, users, playlists, and various commands related to the
audio player. Here are the methods that generate an output, the database of the application
(the library and the playlists), and the users. There is a specialized method for each command.
The methods are called from the main method for that command. The classes AddRemoveInPlaylist,
CreatePlaylist, Follow, GetTop5Playlists, GetTop5Songs, Like, Load, PlayPause, Search, Select,
ShowPlaylists, ShowPreferredSongs, Status, and SwitchVisibility are children of the Command class.
They all represent possible commands that can be used in the application. Each of them has a
method that sets the command, meaning that it reads the input and stores the data in the object.
The method run is also implemented in each of them. It is used to execute the command. The method
run is called from the main class.

The flow of the app:
The main method reads the input file and stores the data in a list of commands. Then the database
of the application is created (the initialization of the Player object). After that, each command
from the list is executed. The parsing of the commands is done with the help of the switch
statement.

Search: For each type of input (song, podcast, playlist), there is a specialized method that checks
the type of filter/filters that were specified and calls the method that searches for that type of
input. After each filter is applied, the result is stored in a list that is returned at the end of
the method. If more than one filter is specified, the result of the previous filter becomes the
input for the next filter. At the end, the list is stored for each user in an array, and the method
that prints the result is called.

Select: This method checks if a search was made before and if the result is not empty. After that,
it checks if the index is valid. If all conditions are met, the input is selected, and the method
that prints the result is called.

Load: This method checks if a search and a select were made before and if the result is not empty.
If they are, the timestamp for the beginning of the song is set, and the method that prints the
result is called.

PlayPause: This method changes the state of the input that was loaded from play to pause or from
pause to play. Also, the remaining time is updated. The method that prints the result is called.

Like: This method checks if a load was made before and if the input is a song. If all conditions
are met, the song is added to the list of liked songs of the user and also to an array of songs
in the player that will be later used to generate the most liked songs. The method that prints
the result is called.

CreatePlaylist: This method creates a new playlist and adds it to the list of playlists of the
user, but also to an array of playlists in the player. The method that prints the result is
called.

AddRemoveInPlaylist: This method adds the loaded song to the playlist specified by the user.
If the song is already in the playlist, it is removed. The method that prints the result is
called.

ShowPlaylists: This method displays all the playlists created by the user. The method that
prints the result is called.

GetTop5Playlists: This method generates a list of the top 5 playlists based on the number of
followers. To generate that list, the playlists are sorted in descending order based on the number
of followers, and the first 5 are selected. The method that prints the result is called.

GetTop5Songs: This method generates a list of the top 5 songs based on the number of likes. To
generate that list, the songs are sorted in descending order based on the number of likes, and the
first 5 are selected. If there are not enough liked songs, the list is completed with songs from
the library. The method that prints the result is called.

Follow: This method checks if the playlist specified by the user exists and if it does, the user
is added to the list of followers of that playlist. The method that prints the result is called.

ShowPreferredSongs: This method generates a list of the songs that were liked by the user. The
method that prints the result is called.

Status: This method displays the current state of the user, meaning the song/podcast episode that
is playing or was paused, the remaining time, if it is on repeat, it is on shuffle, and if it is
paused. The method that prints the result is called.

SwitchVisibility: This method checks if the playlist specified by the user exists and if it does,
the visibility of the playlist is changed. The method that prints the result is called.

The classes Playlist, User, Library, and Player are used to create the database.
